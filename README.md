##Description <br>
  A single-page text editor PWA that runs in browser and offline using multiple data persistence techniques
  that serve as redundancies in case one of the options is not supported. I started with an existing application
  and implemented the methods for getting and storing data to an indexedDB database.

  Uses idb, a wrapper for the indexedDB API, webpack a module bundler, and workbox to generate a service worker
<br><br>
