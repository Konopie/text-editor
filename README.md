# text-editor

##Description <br>
  A single-page text editor PWA that runs in browser and offline using multiple data persistence techniques
  that serve as redundancies in case one of the options is not supported. I started with an existing application
  and implemented the methods for getting and storing data to an indexedDB database. 
<br>
<br>
##Technologies <br>
  Uses idb, a wrapper for the indexedDB API, webpack a module bundler, and workbox to generate a service worker
<br><br>
##Installation <br>
  Install button at the top of page
<br><br>
##Usage <br>
  In browser or on desktop <br> 
  Once page loads, anything you type will be save and be reloaded. <br> 
  Install button at top of page downloads app to desktop
