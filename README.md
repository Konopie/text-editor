# text-editor

##Description 
  A single-page text editor PWA that runs in browser and offline using multiple data persistence techniques
  that serve as redundancies in case one of the options is not supported. I started with an existing application
  and implemented the methods for getting and storing data to an indexedDB database. 

##Technologies 
  Uses idb, a wrapper for the indexedDB API, webpack a module bundler, and workbox to generate a service worker

##Installation
  Install button at the top of page

##Usage 
  In browser or on desktop
